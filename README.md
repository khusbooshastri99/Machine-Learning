'What is Artificial Intelligence.'
'Science that empowers computer to mimic human intelligence such as decision making, text processing and visual perception is called Artificial Intelligence.
And Machine Learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that enables machines to improve at a given task with experience.'
'Branches required to build a Machine Learning model are:-'
1.Data Preprocessing:- Data Preprocessing is a technique that is used to convert the raw data into a clean data set.
2.Regression:- Regression models (both linear and non-linear) are used for predicting a real value, like salary for example. If your independent variable is time, then you are forecasting future values, otherwise your model is predicting present but unknown values.

And there are different forms of regression model:- 
1. Simple Linear Regression:- It is a type of regression analysis where the number of independent variables is one and there is a linear relationship between the independent(x) and dependent(y) variable.
2. Multiple Linear Regression:- It is one of the important regression algorithms which models the linear relationship between a single dependent continuous variable and more than one independent variable. 
3. Polynomial Regression:- It is a regression algorithm that models the relationship between a dependent(y) and independent variable(x) as nth degree polynomial.
4. Support Vector Regression:- It is machine learning algorithm that analyzes data for classification and regression analysis.
5. Decision Tree Regression:- Decision tree regression observes features of an object and trains a model in the structure of a tree to predict data in the future to produce meaningful continuous output.
