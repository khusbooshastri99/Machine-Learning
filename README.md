  Science that empowers computer to mimic human intelligence such as decision making, text processing and visual perception is called Artificial Intelligence.

   Machine Learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that enables machines to improve at a given task with experience.

- [Machine learning are classified in four types](Machine-learning-are-classified-in-four-types)
   
   1. Supervised Machine Learning:- It is a subcategory of machine learning and artificial intelligence. It is defined by its use of labeled datasets to train algorithms that to       classify data or predict outcomes accurately.
      Example of supervised machine learning are:- Regression and Classification.
   
   2. Unsupervised Machine Learning:- Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning in which models are trained using unlabeled dataset and are allowed to act on that data       without any supervision.
      Example of unsepervised machine learning is Clustering.
      
   3. Semi-Supervised Machine Learning:- Semi-supervised machine learning is a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. In semi-supervised                 learning, an algorithm learns from a dataset that includes both labeled and unlabeled data, usually mostly unlabeled.
   
   4. Reinforcement Machine learning:- It is about taking suitable action to maximize reward in a particular situation. It is employed by various software and machines to find         the best possible behavior or path it should take in a specific situation.

   1. Data Preprocessing:- Data Preprocessing is a technique that is used to convert the raw data into a clean data set.

   2. Regression:- Regression models (both linear and non-linear) are used for predicting a real value, like salary for example. If your independent variable is time, then you        are forecasting future values, otherwise your model is predicting present but unknown values.

   - [There are different forms of regression model](There-are-different-forms-of-regression-model)
   
      1. Simple Linear Regression:- It is a type of regression analysis where the number of independent variables is one and there is a linear relationship between the                    independent(x) and dependent(y) variable.
      2. Multiple Linear Regression:- It is one of the important regression algorithms which models the linear relationship between a single dependent continuous variable and            more than one independent variable. 
      3. Polynomial Regression:- It is a regression algorithm that models the relationship between a dependent(y) and independent variable(x) as nth degree polynomial.
      4. Support Vector Regression:- It is machine learning algorithm that analyzes data for classification and regression analysis.
      5. Decision Tree Regression:- Decision tree regression observes features of an object and trains a model in the structure of a tree to predict data in the future to                produce meaningful continuous output. 
      6. Random Forest Regression:- It is a supervised learning algorithm that uses ensemble learning method for regression. Ensemble learning method is a technique that                  combines predictions from multiple machine learning algorithms to make a more accurate prediction than a single model.
