  Science that empowers computer to mimic human intelligence such as decision making, text processing and visual perception is called Artificial Intelligence.

   Machine Learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that enables machines to improve at a given task with experience.

- [Machine learning are classified in four types](Machine-learning-are-classified-in-four-types)
   
   1. Supervised Machine Learning:- It is a subcategory of machine learning and artificial intelligence. It is defined by its use of labeled datasets to train algorithms that to       classify data or predict outcomes accurately.
      Example of supervised machine learning are:- Regression and Classification.
   
   2. Unsupervised Machine Learning:- Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning in which models are trained using unlabeled dataset and are allowed to act on that data       without any supervision.
      Example of unsepervised machine learning is Clustering.
      
   3. Semi-Supervised Machine Learning:- Semi-supervised machine learning is a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. In semi-supervised                 learning, an algorithm learns from a dataset that includes both labeled and unlabeled data, usually mostly unlabeled.
   
   4. Reinforcement Machine learning:- It is about taking suitable action to maximize reward in a particular situation. It is employed by various software and machines to find         the best possible behavior or path it should take in a specific situation.

   1. Data Preprocessing:- Data Preprocessing is a technique that is used to convert the raw data into a clean data set.

   2. Regression:- Regression models (both linear and non-linear) are used for predicting a real value, like salary for example. If your independent variable is time, then you        are forecasting future values, otherwise your model is predicting present but unknown values.

   - [There are different forms of regression model](There-are-different-forms-of-regression-model)
   
      1. Simple Linear Regression:- It is a type of regression analysis where the number of independent variables is one and there is a linear relationship between the                    independent(x) and dependent(y) variable.
      
      2. Multiple Linear Regression:- It is one of the important regression algorithms which models the linear relationship between a single dependent continuous variable and            more than one independent variable. 
      
      3. Polynomial Regression:- It is a regression algorithm that models the relationship between a dependent(y) and independent variable(x) as nth degree polynomial.
     
      4. Support Vector Regression:- It is machine learning algorithm that analyzes data for classification and regression analysis.
     
      5. Decision Tree Regression:- Decision tree regression observes features of an object and trains a model in the structure of a tree to predict data in the future to                produce meaningful continuous output. 
      
      6. Random Forest Regression:- It is a supervised learning algorithm that uses ensemble learning method for regression. Ensemble learning method is a technique that                  combines predictions from multiple machine learning algorithms to make a more accurate prediction than a single model.

  1. Data Preprocessing:- Data Preprocessing is a technique that is used to convert the raw data into a clean data set.
  
  2. Classification:- Classification is a process of categorizing a given set of data into classes, It can be performed on both structured or unstructured data. 
  
  - [There are different forms of Classification model](There-are-different-forms-of-Classification-model)
  
     1. Logistic Regression:- Logistic regression is a supervised learning classification algorithm used to predict the probability of a target variable.The nature of target or           dependent variable is dichotomous, which means there would be only two possible classes.
     
     2. K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN):-The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple, supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and           regression problems.
     
     3. Support Vector Machine (SVM):- SVM is a supervised machine learning algorithm which can be used for classification or regression problems. It uses a technique called the           kernel trick to transform your data and then based on these transformations it finds an optimal boundary between the possible outputs.
     
     4. Kernel SVM:- Kernel is used due to set of mathematical functions used in Support Vector Machine provides the window to manipulate the data. So, Kernel Function generally           transforms the training set of data so that a non-linear decision surface is able to transformed to a linear equation in a higher number of dimension spaces.
     
     5. Naive Bayes:- Naive Bayes classifiers are a collection of classification algorithms based on Bayes’ Theorem. It is not a single algorithm but a family of algorithms where         all of them share a common principle, i.e. every pair of features being classified is independent of each other.
     
     6. Decision Tree Classification:- Decision Tree is a Supervised learning technique that can be used for both classification and Regression problems, but mostly it is                 preferred for solving Classification problems. It is a tree-structured classifier, where internal nodes represent the features of a dataset, branches represent the                 decision rules and each leaf node represents the outcome.
    
    7. Random Forest Classification:-Random forest is a supervised learning algorithm which is used for both classification as well as regression. ... Similarly, random forest            algorithm creates decision trees on data samples and then gets the prediction from each of them and finally selects the best solution by means of voting.

  1.  Data Preprocessing:- Data Preprocessing is a technique that is used to convert the raw data into a clean data set.
  
  2.  Clustering:- Clustering is the task of dividing the population or data points into a number of groups such that data points in the same groups are more similar to other data       points in the same group and dissimilar to the data points in other groups. It is basically a collection of objects on the basis of similarity and dissimilarity between           them.
  
  - [There are two forms of Clustering model](There-are-two-forms-of-Clustering-model)
  
    1. K-Means Clustering:- K-means clustering is one of the simplest and popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms. In other words, the K-means algorithm identifies k            number of centroids, and then allocates every data point to the nearest cluster, while keeping the centroids as small as possible.
    
    2. Hierarchical Clustering:- Hierarchical clustering is another unsupervised learning algorithm that is used to group together the unlabeled data points having similar                characteristics. The hierarchy of the clusters is represented as a dendrogram or tree structure.

   1. Data Preprocessing:- Data Preprocessing is a technique that is used to convert the raw data into a clean data set.

   2. Association rule learning:- Association rule learning is a type of unsupervised learning technique that checks for the dependency of one data item on another data item and       maps accordingly so that it can be more profitable.

   - [There are two types of Association rule learning model](There-are-two-types-of-Association-rule-learning-model)
     
     1. Apriori:- Apriori is an algorithm which searches for a series of frequent sets of items in the datasets. It builds on associations and correlations between the itemsets.         It is the algorithm behind “You may also like” where you commonly saw in recommendation platforms.
     
     2. Eclat:- The ECLAT algorithm stands for Equivalence Class Clustering and bottom-up Lattice Traversal. It is one of the popular methods of Association Rule mining. This             vertical approach of the ECLAT algorithm makes it a faster algorithm than the Apriori algorithm.

  1. Upper Confidence Bound(UCB):- UCB is a deterministic algorithm for Reinforcement Learning that focuses on exploration and exploitation based on a confidence boundary that        the algorithm assigns to each machine on each round of exploration. These boundary decreases when a machine is used more in comparison to other machines.
 
  2. Thompson Sampling:- Thompson Sampling is an approach that successfully tackles the problem. Thompson Sampling makes use of Probability Distribution and Bayes Rule to            predict the success rates of each Slot machine.
